# Winx Avatar
This Repo is a replica of https://winxavatar.com and can be used to host your own instance of the Game. All you need is a webserver with PHP installed.

# How to use:
1. Upload the files to your webserver
2. In config.php, change variable baseURL to the URL path where the uploaded files are located (e.g. https://mywebsite.com/game/winxavatar/)

# Note
When images are being shared via social media, the generated Avatars will be saved in the "userImages" directory.
